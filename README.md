# Hydration bands in Gaia DR3 asteroid reflectance spectra

This project builds on and continues the work done by Joost Barendse for his first MSc research project at Leiden Observatory, Leiden University. He was supervised by Marco Delbo (Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, Nice, France), Ashish Mahabal (Caltech, Pasadena, USA), and Anthony Brown (Leiden Observatory, Leiden, Netherlands).

__This project is based on [https://github.com/joostbar/asteroids](https://github.com/joostbar/asteroids)__

## Aim
The aim of this project is to analyse the reflectance spectra of 60518 asteroids and try to detect a feature in the spectra around 700 nm, the OH band, which is indicative of primitive aqueous alteration, namely that in the parent body (or parent planetesimal) of the asteroid where the OH feature is seen, liquid water was present at some point. 

In combination with the data on asteroid orbits provided by Gaia, an analysis of this feature can provide insights into where hydration (i.e. water) was present in the primitive solar system. In this project asteroid photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility will also be used to see what more can be learned about the asteroids with the OH feature present.

## Additional data 
* Orbital data from the [MP3C](https://mp3c.oca.eu/) database.
